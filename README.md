## Why VoxSherpa?

Most TTS apps make you choose between **quality** and **privacy**. Cloud-based tools like ElevenLabs sound incredible — but they require internet, send your text to remote servers, and charge per character.

**VoxSherpa breaks that tradeoff.**

It runs two professional-grade neural engines entirely on your device:

| Engine | Quality | Speed | Best For |
|--------|---------|-------|----------|
| 🧠 **Kokoro-82M** | Studio-grade · rivals ElevenLabs | Slower on budget hardware | Audiobooks, voiceovers, professional content |
| ⚡ **Piper / VITS** | Natural · clear | Fast on any device | Daily use, quick synthesis |

**Built with:**
- [Sherpa-ONNX](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx) — on-device neural inference
- [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) — multilingual neural TTS model
- [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) — fast local TTS
- Android AudioTrack API — low-latency PCM playback

## Performance

Generation speed depends entirely on your device's processor:

| Device Tier | Kokoro | Piper |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| 🟢 Flagship (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3) | ~20–40 sec/min audio | ~5 sec/min audio |
| 🟡 Mid-range (8-core) | ~60–90 sec/min audio | ~10 sec/min audio |
| 🔴 Budget (6-core) | ~2–3 min/min audio | ~20 sec/min audio |

> Kokoro prioritizes **quality over speed** by design. It uses the same 82M parameter architecture that powers premium commercial TTS — running it entirely offline on a mobile CPU is genuinely pushing the hardware limits.
